# Anomaly Detection for Credit Card Fraud Prediction

Welcome to the Anomaly Detection for Credit Card Fraud Prediction project! In the realm of financial transactions, detecting fraudulent activities is paramount to safeguarding the integrity of the system. This project focuses on leveraging anomaly detection techniques to identify and prevent credit card fraud, thereby protecting both consumers and financial institutions from potential losses.

**Introduction**

Credit card fraud poses a significant threat in today's digital age, with fraudsters constantly devising new tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in payment systems. Traditional rule-based approaches often fall short in detecting sophisticated fraudulent transactions, necessitating the adoption of advanced anomaly detection methods.

**Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust anomaly detection system capable of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions accurately and efficiently. By analyzing transactional data, we aim to uncover patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior and deploy proactive measures to mitigate risks.

**Dataset**

We utilize a comprehensive dataset containing credit card transaction records, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing our anomaly detection models, enabling us to evaluate their performance in real-world scenarios.

**Methodology**

1. Data Preprocessing
We preprocess the raw transaction data, handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables to prepare it for analysis.

2. Anomaly Detection Techniques
We employ various anomaly detection techniques, such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM), to identify anomalous transactions indicative of fraud.

3. Model Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of each anomaly detection model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

4. Model Deployment
Upon selecting the most effective anomaly detection model, we deploy it into production to continuously monitor credit card transactions in real-time, alerting stakeholders to potential fraud attempts for timely intervention.
